# Overview {#overview}

This module teaches students about the historical dimensions of data: both the historical process and context within which datasets are produced, and how data has been used and misused at different points in history.

# Learning Outcomes {#outcomes}

Through this module, students will be able to:
- *Approach data as a historical artifact and object of analysis*
- *Understand how data was collected, used, and misused within different historical contexts*
- *Analyze the origins and contexts of particular datasets: who, what, when, where, why, and how they were created*
- *Work with tabular data and spreadsheets*

# Key Concepts {#concepts}

Through this module, students will be able to define and consider the following concepts:

**Data as Archive**
> Students will learn to approach data as historical artificats. Rather than seeing data as purely a source of quantitative information, this module approaches data as archival documents with their own cultural, political, and social histories.

**Data Biography**
> All datasets are actively created. Rather than seeing data as objective reflections of the world, this module teaches students how to analyze the creators and contexts of datasets: the historical who, when, where, how, and why of a dataset's creation.

**Tabular Data**
> Tabular data, often stored as spreadsheets, is one of the most common data formats students will encounter. This module teaches how tabular data is formated and some basic skills in how to explore tabular data.

### {.tabs style=height:275px}

#### Day 2.1: Data Histories

This class introduces students to "historicizing data" - the idea that data is not simply quantifiable information, but all data has a history behind it that shaped its production. 

[Link to full lesson plan.](/module-2/2-1/)

#### Day 2.2: Slavery and Data

This class examines the role of data within one of the defining topics in U.S. history: slavery. It offers a lens into how the system of chattel slavery in the United States rested on a foundation of data, and how enslavers constructed, recorded, and used data.

[Link to full lesson plan.](/module-2/2-2/)

#### Day 2.3: The US Census

This class studies the history of one of the major sources of data used by researchers, activists, and policy-makers today: the US Census. 

[Link to full lesson plan.](/module-2/2-3/)

#### Day 2.4: Working with Data

This class brings the concept of "historicizing data" into the present by examining a particular topic and kind of data that students are likely personally familiar with: public health data related to COVID-19.
