# Module 2: Historicizing Data

## Overview {#overview}

This module teaches students about the historical dimensions of data: both the historical process and context within which datasets are produced, and how data has been used and misused at different points in history.

## Learning Outcomes {#outcomes}

Through this module, students will be able to:

- *Approach data as a historical artifact and object of analysis*
- *Understand how data was collected, used, and misused within different historical contexts*
- *Analyze the origins and contexts of particular datasets: who, what, when, where, why, and how they were created*
- *Work with tabular data and spreadsheets*

## Key Concepts {#concepts}

Through this module, students will be able to define and consider the following concepts:

**Data as Archive**
> Students will learn to approach data as historical artificats. Rather than seeing data as purely a source of quantitative information, this module approaches data as archival documents with their own cultural, political, and social histories.

**Data Biography**
> All datasets are actively created. Rather than seeing data as objective reflections of the world, this module teaches students how to analyze the creators and contexts of datasets: the historical who, when, where, how, and why of a dataset's creation.

**Tabular Data**
> Tabular data, often stored as spreadsheets, is one of the most common data formats students will encounter. This module teaches how tabular data is formated and some basic skills in how to explore tabular data.

## Schedule: {#schedule}

>`CB: I'm providing two options for how we might want to offer an overview of each lesson plan - either as a list of links or using Juncutre's tab version. Also, we might think about different URL / subfolder conventions. Ex. /historicizing-data/ is the main folder and overview page for the module, then we could have /historicizing-data/day-1/ as the URL to lesson plan for Day 2.1`

- [Day 2.1: Data Histories](/module-2/2-1/)
- [Day 2.2: Slavery and Data](/module-2/2-2/)
- [Day 2.3: The US Census](/module-2/2-3/)
- [Day 2.4: Working with Data](/module-2/2-4/)

### {.tabs style=height:300px}

#### Day 2.1: Data Histories

This class introduces students to "historicizing data" - the idea that data is not simply quantifiable information, but all data has a history behind it that shaped its production. 

[Link to full lesson plan.](/module-2/2-1/)

#### Day 2.2: Slavery and Data

This class examines the role of data within one of the defining topics in U.S. history: slavery. It offers a lens into how the system of chattel slavery in the United States rested on a foundation of data, and how enslavers constructed, recorded, and used data.

#### Day 2.3: The US Census

This class studies the history of one of the major sources of data used by researchers, activists, and policy-makers today: the US Census. 

[Link to full lesson plan.](/module-2/2-3/)

#### Day 2.4: Working with Data

This class brings the concept of "historicizing data" into the present by examining a particular topic and kind of data that students are likely personally familiar with: public health data related to COVID-19.

## Activities {#activities}

>`CB: I think we should get rid of the Activities section on module overview page and just have Activities listed under each lesson plan for a class`

## Assessment {#assessment}

### Data Biography

Your assignment is to write a "data biography" about a historical dataset.[^1] This is the dataset you will be examining: [Philadelphia African American Census 1847](https://ds-pages.swarthmore.edu/paac/). I am not providing you with any additional information about the dataset beyond the above link. You will need to put on your detective hats and try to familiarize yourself with the data and its history. Make sure that you download the actual dataset and take a look at its contents in addition to tracking down its history. Your data biography should tell a story about the dataset that addresses the following:

- **Introduce** the dataset and its contents. What kind of information is in there? How much data is there? 
- **Where** did it come from? 
- **Who** collected, processed, and made it available?
- **How** was it collected, processed, and made available?
- **Why** was it collected, processed, and made available?
- **How** is it stored today? How did you access it?
- **Potential problems** with the data - are there any limitations, biases, missing data or gaps, or ethical considerations to consider when using this data?

Note that, like most historical datasets, answering some of these questions will require you to think about the multiple stages through which this information has passed to get to its current state as machine-readable data. So "Who collected it?" needs to include both the original historical actors who created the information along with the subsequent people who ultimately made it available for you.

>`CB: Alternatively we could have a short one-sentence summary of the assignment on the overview page and then have something like: [Link to full assignment description](/module-2/data-biography/) with a separate page for the assignment itself.
